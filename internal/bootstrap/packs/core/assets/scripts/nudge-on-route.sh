# nudge-on-route — wake the target session the moment a bead is routed to it.
#
# `gc sling` does not nudge warm-idle workers (issue #1129, closed by
# design: cities that reuse warm workers were told to "introduce orders
# that trigger on new beads being created and manually nudge the workers
# in the warm set"). Without that nudge, a bead whose metadata.gc.routed_to
# is newly set or changed sits unclaimed against any worker that is not
# currently in an active turn cycle.
#
# This order is exactly that workaround, shipped. It subscribes to
# bead.updated events; whenever a bead carries a gc.routed_to target it
# runs `gc session nudge <target> "<message>"`. Idempotent: a given
# (bead, routed_to) pair is nudged at most once. Dedup state lives in
# $GC_PACK_STATE_DIR/nudge-on-route-state.json, so it is both city- and
# pack-scoped — multi-city installs never cross-pollinate.
#
# Runs as an exec order (no LLM, no agent, no wisp).
