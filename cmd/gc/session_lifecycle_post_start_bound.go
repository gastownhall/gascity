// post-stability liveness check and the pane read of a resume that check finds
// dead (postStartDeathPane). The call under the wait can hang on a wedged
// tmux subprocess or a stalled store and nothing cancels it, so on expiry the
// wait is abandoned instead of holding the async start slot. An abandoned
// observation defers the start as runtime-unavailable (SESSION-RUNTIME-009);
// an abandoned pane read reads empty, and the death the liveness check already
