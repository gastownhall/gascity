// The proxied acceptance files are gated twice: by a build tag, and by the
// -run expression of whichever CI step selects them. The tag is easy to get
// right and easy to check; the selector is neither, and getting it wrong is
// silent in the worst possible way.
//
// It happened. TestProxiedNativeLifecycle (695 lines) and
// TestProxiedNativeSafety (550 lines) carried //go:build acceptance_a, sat in
// a directory the beads_topology path filter matches, and were named by no
// -run expression in any job — so the proxied-native lane's entire evidence
// base ran exactly once, on the author's box: the per-crash-shape ping and
// recover budgets, foreign-root's "0 pings, 0 dolt stop", the no-spawn
// positive control, both no-migrate rows (the BD_ALLOW_REMOTE_MIGRATE consent
// fence) and the author-at-commit pin. A regression in any of them would have
// landed green, and the two files would read as gates forever (council pr2
// C-F1).
//
// This is the guard for that. It lives in ./scripts rather than in ci.yml
// because ./scripts is inside UNIT_COVER_PKGS_NONCMDGC, which CI already runs
// as "Preflight / unit cover (noncmdgc)" — so it is enforced with no workflow
// edit and no shape-hash bump, the same route
// scripts/check_split_topology_rows_test.go established.
//
// It deliberately does NOT try to evaluate Go's -run grammar. It asserts the
// weaker, checkable thing: the function's name appears somewhere in a CI
// `go test` step's -run expression. A selector that names a function but
// cannot match it is a different bug, and one a green CI run makes visible;
// a selector that never mentions the function at all is invisible forever.
